# Maggi-Dashboard

## Problem Statement

Maggi faced a significant decline in sales and market trust due to the 2015 ban, affecting its revenue, market share, and customer loyalty. The challenge is to analyze Maggi’s sales trends, identify top-selling regions & categories, and suggest strategies to maintain long-term growth.

## My Task

As a hypothetical applicant for this role, I was tasked with:

## Writing dax to find the solution.

Creating a dashboard to showcase these insights, targeting top-level management.

## My Approach

Data Extraction with EXCEL, POWER BI:

Used POWER BI to write queries and fetch the needed data.

## Data Visualization:

Used Power BI to create visuals that made the insights easy to understand and engaging.

## Presentation Design:

Created a clear and professional dashboard in POWER BI to share the insights.

## Actionable Insights:

- Revenue showed a significant drop in 2019, despite previously growing year-on-year. This suggests a possible market disruption, regulatory ban, or supply chain issue during that year.
- "Healthier" and "Classic & Regular" categories dominate total sales volume, jointly contributing over 66% of total demand, indicating these are the most preferred consumer segments.
- While "Classic" and "Healthier" variants drive high volume sales each year (stacked bars), the revenue line trend remains relatively flat, suggesting pricing pressure or a shift to lower-margin variants.
- There is a steep drop-off in volume from the top-selling variant to others, indicating heavy reliance on a few SKUs. Optimizing or promoting lower-ranked variants can reduce risk.
- Spain and Ukraine consistently lead in sales volume across years, showing strong market penetration in those countries, while other regions underperform, indicating growth potential.
- Despite consistent or growing sales volume (columns), the average price (line) trend shows fluctuation — possibly due to promotions, pricing strategy shifts, or inflationary factors.

## Outcome

This project showed that I can handle complex data and share insights in a clear and interesting way. It helped me improve both my technical skills and my ability to explain things well.

This project highlights my skills in data analysis, data visualization, and presentation design by via dashboard in a business setting. It demonstrates my ability to extract and present actionable insights from data, supporting data-driven decision-making in a corporate environment.
